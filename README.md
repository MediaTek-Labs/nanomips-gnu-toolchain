# Introduction

The nanoMIPS Toolchain includes example code, source code, and documentation to facilitate development of bare metal applications on nanoMIPS simulators and development boards. These toolchains provide compilers, linkers, libraries and utilities for building applications to run on nanoMIPS cores.

#### Component	Description

* GCC Bare Metal Toolchain <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a software engineer's cross-development system for nanoMIPS processors, intended for statically linked embedded applications running on bare metal CPUs or light-weight operating systems.
* GCC Linux (MUSL) Toolchain<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; For compiling Linux applications for Linux running on nanoMIPS cores.
